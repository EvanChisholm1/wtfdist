# Where the F*ck did I see that?

where the f*ck did I see that (wtfdist) is a project for helping you find things that you have recently seen on the internet but can't remember where. Think of it like your web bookmarks but on steroids. There should be a very powerfull search component to it so everything is just one search away. Potentially you could even add other datasources that could import all your saved posts on reddit or upvoted posts on hacker news.
